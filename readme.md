Hi!

Thanks for taking the time to review my submission! Please find included in this solution:
- Core Domain / Class Library (Slots)
- Game / Driver application (Slots.Game)
- xUnit Test Project (Slots.Tests)

```
dotnet test
dotnet run --project .\Slots.Game\Slots.Game.csproj
```

Any feedback / improvements would be very useful, I'm always looking to improve my structure/dotnet/c# skills,
so if you spot anything that you would approach differently or could be modified for improvement please
let me know! (kylemartinriley@gmail.com)

I tried to not take longer than 2 hours working on this application, there are things I would do
differently if I were to re-write it, but overall I'm pretty happy with the solution.

Thanks again for your time,
`Kyle Martin ðŸŽ‰`
